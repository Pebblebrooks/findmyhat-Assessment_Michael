/*
This program generates a field of a specified size with a certain percentage of holes and a randomly placed hat. 

The player starts at position 0,0 and can move up, down, left or right. The game ends if the player falls into a hole or moves out of bounds, or if the player finds the hat. 

The code will continue to prompt user for a valid move until the game ends or user breaks the program. 

For higher difficulty levels, user can increase no. of holes on the board by increasing the percentage. However, game does not contain any logic to ensure user is not blocked and has at least one clear path to the hat or such that user is not placed too close to the starting position.
